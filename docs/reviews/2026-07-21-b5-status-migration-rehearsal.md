# B5 invocation status migration rehearsal

> Date: 2026-07-21 (Asia/Seoul)  
> Branch/base: `worker/v24-b5-status` / `033a721`  
> Scope: require `active_turns.*.invocations.*.status`, backfill legacy omissions as `closed`, and preserve a fail-closed no-write path when auto migration is off.

## Policy decision

Three compatibility paths were evaluated.

1. Requiring `status` without a compatibility boundary was rejected: an old ledger would raise during an adapter read and could escape into a host-level fail-open path.
2. Unconditional persisted backfill was rejected: it would bypass the requested opt-in and would rewrite a live ledger without an auditable rollback source.
3. The implemented path is explicit and fail-closed:
   - `FABLE_LITE_AUTO_MIGRATION=1` plus both packaged green receipts enables migration.
   - ON: copy in memory, add only missing `status: "closed"`, validate the entire v2 schema, preserve immutable `ledger.v2-invocation-status.json.bak`, then atomically replace and re-read.
   - OFF: leave source bytes untouched, expose an in-memory `closed` compatibility view with `attribution_degraded=true`, block destructive R2 work, and reject every attempt to persist that view. The non-persistable marker also prevents a stale OFF view from overwriting a concurrent successful migration.

This makes an old project visibly degraded rather than silently broken or silently rewritten. Normal operation resumes after explicit migration; malformed fields unrelated to `status` are not repaired or archived by this narrow migration.

## Regression-first evidence

Before production changes:

```text
python -X utf8 -m pytest tests/test_w3_legacy_invocation_compat.py::test_invocation_without_status_is_rejected_at_the_schema_boundary -q
FAILED: DID NOT RAISE LedgerSchemaError
```

The full pre-fix B5 selection then reported `7 failed, 3 passed`: schema omission allowed, migration APIs/archive absent, OFF load healthy, and the environment opt-in ignored. A later concurrency regression first failed with `assert True is False`, proving that a stale degraded view could overwrite a ledger after another process migrated it.

After implementation, the focused migration/schema/concurrency selection reported `24 passed`.

## Real-ledger copy setup

The live source was read only. Both rehearsal files were copied from the same snapshot of:

```text
C:\Users\gustj\fable-lite-dev\.fable-lite\ledger.json
```

PowerShell rehearsal root:

```text
C:\Users\gustj\fable-lite-dev\tmp\b5-status-rehearsal
```

Git Bash equivalent:

```text
/c/Users/gustj/fable-lite-dev/tmp/b5-status-rehearsal
```

The sealed real-ledger copy and initial work copy had the same SHA-256:

```text
D9781D447E073E005DB25A4F5A68ACFD75E413BBC7A2161B85995A9AFC53636C
```

The real snapshot was already strict-valid: schema v2, 71 invocation rows, 70 `closed`, 1 `open`, and 0 missing statuses. To exercise the historical shape, only the isolated work copy had `status` removed from one previously closed row:

```text
agent key:    codex_cli:019f8119-79d8-7f11-8393-784ec2058b26:codex
invocation:   exec-03e89e1b-ab81-4fda-b13a-dcbdc84f951f
seed SHA-256: A2DF163EDAD59619DED2C74410961724A86F4490AF1BA41270732186B0D3E7B3
```

No live source path was passed to the migration function.

## Observations

### OFF behavior

The strict schema rejected the seeded copy at the exact `.invocations.<id>.status` field. `load_ledger()` returned `attribution_degraded=true` and an in-memory `status=closed`. The work-copy hash remained `A2DF...E7B3`, confirming zero persistence.

### Backfill and preservation

After `migrate_v2_invocation_statuses()`:

```text
strict_valid:                  true
rows:                          71
missing:                       0
open:                          1
closed:                        70
only_expected_semantic_change: true
```

The comparison added `status=closed` to the archived JSON in memory and then compared the complete object to the migrated ledger. Equality was exact, so every existing row and non-target field was preserved. The migrated ledger hash was `D978...636C`, exactly matching the sealed real-ledger copy.

The immutable archive hash was `A2DF...E7B3`, exactly matching the seeded pre-migration bytes.

### Idempotence

Two additional migration calls produced the same value and left the ledger hash unchanged:

```text
before:             d9781d447e073e005db25a4f5a68acfd75e413bbc7a2161b85995a9afc53636c
after first rerun:  d9781d447e073e005db25a4f5a68acfd75e413bbc7a2161b85995a9afc53636c
after second rerun: d9781d447e073e005db25a4f5a68acfd75e413bbc7a2161b85995a9afc53636c
```

### Rollback and reapply

The rehearsal atomically restored `ledger.json` from the archive. Its SHA-256 became `A2DF...E7B3`, exactly matching the archived legacy bytes. Reapplying the migration restored `D978...636C`, again matching the sealed real-ledger copy.

Fault injection separately confirms that a failed destination replace restores the original bytes, and validation failure on any unrelated malformed field leaves the source untouched without creating a misleading archive.

## Verdict

PASS: strict rejection, opt-in-only persistence, OFF degraded fail-closed behavior, immutable archive, existing-row preservation, idempotence, atomic failure restoration, byte-exact rollback, and reapply were all observed on an isolated copy of the real ledger.
