## 🎯 What is this? (for non-developers / vibe coders)

When you ask an AI (Claude, Codex…) to write code, it's capable but sometimes **careless**:

- It changes code and says "done" **without actually running it**
- It builds a page and ends with "just open it in a browser" (never looked itself)
- It picks **one guess** for a bug and fixes that (maybe the wrong spot)
- It says "I'll do X next" and just **stops**

`show-me-the-work` is an **automatic quality inspector** that sits next to the AI. When the AI tries to call something "done" without checking, it **blocks and demands evidence**. You do nothing — install once, and it works on every task.

> Think of it as a flexible QA supervisor assigned to a skilled-but-careless worker. Silent most of the time; it only steps in the moment someone says "done" without proof.

**One honest caveat**: show-me-the-work doesn't make the AI *smarter* — it just makes cutting corners *impossible to finish*. (In a real on/off comparison, correctness was identical; what differed was how rigorously the work got verified.)

## 📖 Why "show-me-the-work"

This project was renamed from **fable-lite** in v2.0. It began by asking whether Fable 5's working discipline could be transferred to lower models. The answer was useful but narrower than imitation: model capability cannot be transplanted, while verification, investigation, and completion discipline can be enforced as procedure.

By v2.0, the product had grown into **evidence-based AI work supervision** across Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity. The old name described the starting experiment; the new name describes the product.

The name reverses two familiar cheat-code memes: StarCraft's `show me the money` and the broader "show me" challenge. This is the anti-cheat version: **Show me the work.** Don't tell the user it passed — show the run, the observation, and the evidence.

## 🤝 Synergy with LazyCodex (ulw)

[LazyCodex/OmO](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent)'s `ulw` drives tasks to completion; show-me-the-work inspects evidence at every completion attempt — the roles don't overlap. Run both on Codex CLI (`adapters/codex_cli/INSTALL.ko.md`) and you get runs that **push all the way through, but can't finish with an unverified "done"**. This repository itself was built with that combo (implemented under ulw, inspected by smtw).

## 💬 Common objections (FAQ)

### "Hooks don't actually force anything — the AI can just ignore them."

**Asking in words and blocking in code are different things.** That objection is true for the first half only.

- Writing "always verify before finishing" in a prompt is a **request**. The AI can ignore it — in our measurement, instruction-only compliance was **0/3**.
- show-me-the-work is not a request; it is a **lock**. Until the condition (evidence of an actually-executed verification) is met, the "done" declaration and tool calls are **rejected at the program level**. There is no layer where the model gets to "decide not to comply" — the same measurement showed hard gates converging to **3/3** blocked-then-recovered-with-real-evidence ([experiment report](docs/reviews/p5b-n1-natural.md)).

One fun piece of evidence: while building this repository, **even a frontier model (Fable 5) got blocked by this gate and had to rewrite its report.** Hooks don't rely on the model's goodwill.

### "Verification is the human's job. Why build this at all?"

Agreed — **final responsibility stays with the human, and show-me-the-work doesn't replace that.** What it blocks is the step before: **the AI claiming "I verified it" while having executed nothing.**

- People who can't read code (a core audience of this tool) have **no way to tell** that claim is fake.
- People who can read code still can't personally verify the thousands of lines an AI produces per day.

show-me-the-work is a **first-pass filter**: no executed evidence, no "done". It doesn't remove human verification — it raises the trustworthiness of what reaches the human.

### "Can't the AI just fill in the format and slip through?"

**In theory, yes. We can't fully prevent it and don't claim to.** However:

1. The gate **doesn't trust the AI's words — it reads tool results**: not the sentence "tests passed", but whether a test command actually ran and succeeded.
2. The behavior change is **measured, blind-judged**: ON won 5/5 tasks, and every gap appeared exactly where verification gets tedious ([A/B report](docs/reviews/e1-ab-report.md)).
3. It doesn't block forever — after 2 blocks it lets the run proceed (no deadlocks). That's a safety valve, and an honest limitation we document.

In short: **show-me-the-work is not a tool that makes you trust the AI — it's a tool that lets you trust it less.**

## Technical summary

A Korean-first, evidence-based AI work supervisor with live hook receipts for Claude Code and Codex CLI, plus an Antigravity adapter validated by payload injection. It enforces investigation, verification grounding, evidence-gated completion, scope control, and high-risk contracts as **deterministic hooks**, not suggestions.

**A procedure transplant, not a capability transplant.** Weight-level abilities (out-of-spec defect discovery, self-driven implication depth) are explicitly out of scope; the harness escalates honestly instead of pretending.

## Why hooks, not prompts

In a live 3-run experiment with unrestricted tools ([report](docs/reviews/p5b-n1-natural.md)), pack instructions alone produced **0/3** natural compliance; the deterministic Stop gate converged all three runs to *one block → one full recovery* with real evidence (file:line citations, re-run outputs). Discipline packs tell the model *what* to do; hooks make skipping it impossible to finish.

In a controlled ON-vs-OFF A/B (5 tasks, blind-judged by a different model — [report](docs/reviews/e1-ab-report.md)): **ON won 5/5 (137 vs 109 rubric points)**. Correctness was identical; the gap opens exactly where verification gets inconvenient — the render task (OFF: *"just open it in a browser"* vs ON: real browser observation) and the multi-story task (OFF made zero verification attempts).

The qualitative gap **held across 3 repeat runs** (OFF verified 0/3, ON 3/3), though the *cost multiplier* swings too much to quote as a single number ([repeat study](docs/reviews/e1b-repeat.md)) — which also surfaced and fixed a real verification-crediting bug in the harness. We report what replicates and flag what doesn't.

## What's inside

| Gate | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Investigation protocol (3+ hypotheses, evidence, rejections) | pack + **N1 compliance parser** on Stop (bilingual markers) |
| Verification grounding (RUN→OBSERVE→FIX→RE-RUN) | pack + evidence ledger |
| Evidence-gated completion | Stop hook blocks changed-but-unverified turns (max 2, fail-open) |
| Filesystem provenance | bounded snapshots, per-turn baselines, and full Stop reconciliation |
| Scope drift detection | PostToolUse warning |
| High-risk contract (auth/migration/payment/mass-delete) | PreToolUse **hard block** until `.fable-lite/contract.json` exists |
| Korean-first routing | "버그 고쳐줘", "왜 안 돼" → investigation pack |
| Goals checkpoints | `goals/goals.py` CLI, verify-with-evidence required |
| Session Scorecard | per-session block, recovery, and cap counts from an append-only gate journal |

Pure-stdlib Python core (zero Claude Code imports — platform-neutral, adapters are thin wrappers), single state dir `.fable-lite/`, every hook fail-open, Windows-native.

> Compatibility note: the internal state path remains `.fable-lite/` in v2.0 to avoid breaking existing installations. A public alias is planned for v2.1.

Non-document file changes require a fresh successful verification in every task mode (`quick`, `normal`, and `deep`). No change and documentation-only turns retain their existing allow behavior.

### Host support

| Host | Current status |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | live hook chain confirmed |
| Codex CLI | live hook chain confirmed |
| Antigravity | payload-injection conformance confirmed; live firing on host 1.1.1 is not confirmed |

### State and honest limits

User state remains under `.fable-lite/`. The main ledger, goals, intent/contract files, per-agent JSONL logs, bounded session-scorecard cache, provenance configuration, snapshots, turn baselines, gate journal, locks, and recovery backups all live there. Important paths include `ledger.json`, `agents/*.jsonl`, `snapshots/workspace-current.json`, `snapshots/turns/**`, `scorecard/gates.jsonl`, and `provenance-config.json`.

- Stop blocks at most twice and then fail-opens; this prevents deadlocks but is not an adversarial-model security boundary.
- Files outside the project root and database or network side effects are not directly observed.
- Provenance supports up to 10,000 tracked entries and 256 MiB. A full Stop reconciliation near that envelope can take several seconds. Larger or slower scopes return an explicit advisory-only `scope too large` state instead of committing a partial snapshot. Time limits are cooperative between filesystem calls and hash chunks; one blocked OS call cannot be preempted.
- Direct `ssh` and local-to-remote `scp` attempts are tracked as remote mutation epochs independently of possible local effects, even when the overall command fails after a partial remote mutation. A later, separately started successful verification, including a local-only check, can satisfy the epoch; this does not prove that remote state was observed as clean. Shell commands keep local snapshot observation enabled, so redirects, pipelines, chains, substitutions, and unsafe SSH options take both the conservative local path and the remote epoch path when applicable. Query/forward-only SSH operations and `scp` downloads do not create remote epochs.
- Promise-only text completion remains manual probe `PRB-01`; there is no dedicated blocking rule. Independent per-gate toggles remain manual probe `PRB-11` and are not implemented.
- The harness improves work discipline and evidence quality. It does not make a model more capable or guarantee complete defense against deliberate evasion.

## Install

**Requires Python 3.12+ on PATH in the target environment** — the hooks are stdlib-Python scripts, so a host without a resolvable `python` (e.g. a fresh worker box) must install it first. No third-party packages.

Claude Code supervision is a quiet per-project opt-in. Create
`<project>/.fable-lite/config.json` with exactly
`{"schema_version":1,"supervision":true}` to enable it. A missing config,
`false`, or a non-boolean value leaves every hook as a silent no-op; the exact
user home directory is always disabled. `SMTW_TEST_FORCE_ENABLE=1` bypasses
the config check only for automated adapter tests and must not be used for
normal or production sessions.

Initial `cwd fallback is best-effort`, not a security boundary: before Claude
provides `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` or a session root is latched, a forged hook
payload/cwd can steer the initial upward config search. Once present, the env
root is effective for that hook and the write-once latch remains unchanged.
For a corrupt inactive config, a once-per-session warning and TTL cleanup may
write only under global plugin data; the inactive project tree is never
written.

Recommended local-clone install:

```
git clone https://github.com/pinetreeB/show-me-the-work
claude plugin marketplace add <path-to-show-me-the-work>
/plugin install show-me-the-work@show-me-the-work
```

After the plugin is registered in a marketplace, `/plugin marketplace add pinetreeB/show-me-the-work` can replace the local path step.

## Verify

```
python -m pytest tests/ -q      # unit tests
python eval/run_probes.py --strict  # deterministic probe suite; 15 pass, 0 fail, 3 manual
python eval/e2e_smoke.py        # full hook-chain smoke (real CC payload schema)
```
