# Changelog

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Made R2 deny auditing fail fast when the ledger lock is busy, preserving the blocking response's one-second budget while leaving deterministic events retryable through the durable outbox. Malformed outbox entries are now rejected before mutation and persist `coordination_degraded` instead of escaping from ledger serialization.
- Made turn bootstrap recovery atomic under the root ledger lock with first-valid-write-wins baseline creation, CAS baseline advancement, explicit missing/ready/degraded states, crash-residue adoption, and live-owner-safe stale-lock recovery. A READY turn is accepted only when its physical baseline exists and its snapshot ID matches the ledger.
- Made coordination projection durable without changing gate decisions: a bounded 256-entry ledger outbox commits with the authoritative transition, drains after unlock through the strict exact-content writer, acknowledges by CAS, retries crash cuts, and reports overflow/schema/I/O damage through `coordination_degraded`.
- Reconciled `COMPLETE_WITH_EXCLUSIONS` PostTool observations by replaying trustworthy turn deltas in memory while filtering every excluded path under the result snapshot's canonical case policy. Excluded peer changes are never attributed to the caller; non-excluded observer contention remains visible.
- Stopped deterministic probe runs from dirtying tracked files. `eval/results/` is ignored and CI writes probe receipts to runner temporary storage.
- Made benchmark RSS accounting phase-local. Timing samples no longer reuse the process-lifetime high-water mark, and the dedicated memory probe polls current RSS during each action so earlier benchmark phases cannot create false SLO failures.
- Fixed `scorecard --view coordination` reporting `first_observed_at`/`last_observed_at` from journal append order instead of event timestamps, which could show `last_observed_at` earlier than `first_observed_at` when coordination events are appended out of chronological order (retried/delayed outbox drains). Bounds are now the true `min`/`max` of `occurred_at` across each group.
- Removed the committed `uv.lock`: it was not part of the documented install/CI workflow (plain `pip`/`python -m pytest`, no CI step reads it) and had drifted to a stale pinned package version. `uv.lock` is now git-ignored, and both `scripts/sync_version.py --check` and `tests/test_release_hygiene.py` fail if one is committed again, so this decision cannot silently regress.

### Changed

- Moved the two reviewed green migration-gate receipts from mutable `eval/results/` output into package data at `core/release_receipts/`. This also fixes clean wheels silently keeping v1 dual-read because `eval/` was never packaged. Source checkouts and wheel installs now evaluate the same W9/W10 evidence; fresh measurements do not self-promote into release approval.

### Known Limitations

- Atomic replace does not include directory fsync durability across sudden power loss. Stale-lock recovery does not yet compare process start time, so PID reuse remains a hardening backlog.
- A tombstone-free stale turn written by a pre-upgrade version cannot always be distinguished from a live child turn.
- Coordination payloads are count-bounded but have no per-entry byte ceiling; bootstrap timestamp validation is conservative at delivery time, and the journal/parser and ledger validators duplicate part of the schema contract.
- `PEER_EXCLUSION` coordination audit, stronger peer-exclusion lease policy, and durable ledger events for cumulative replay remain follow-up work. The W3 replay fix intentionally changes only in-memory attribution; immediate PostTool deltas remain durably recorded as before.
- REL-01's git-tag-matches-version and clean-wheel-install checks already ran in `.github/workflows/release-quality.yml` before this change and were left as-is; `test_all_release_version_surfaces_are_synchronized` only covers the offline, file-based version surfaces plus the uv.lock policy. A `smtw`/`fable-lite --version` output command remains PKG-01 follow-up work, not part of this fix.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- `resume_turn` bootstrap retry treated `COMPLETE_WITH_EXCLUSIONS` as failure (strict `is COMPLETE` comparison), defeating the F3 peer-activity rescue exactly in its target scenario — concurrent multi-agent boot on a fresh store. Bootstrap success now uses the shared completion helper, and `begin_invocation` no longer drops `candidate_paths` registration on the recovery path. Reproduced 100% by two independent probes before the fix.
- `turn_not_started` recovery is now explicit: an invocation that successfully full-bootstraps a missing baseline records `baseline_status=ready`, `provenance_incomplete=false`, `provenance_status=complete`, and an empty status reason in one ledger write, instead of depending on a later PostToolUse to accidentally overwrite the stale state (which a PostToolUse fail-open could leave behind forever). Failed bootstraps keep the conservative `turn_not_started` state unchanged.
- Windows long-path atomic writes: on hosts with `LongPathsEnabled=0` (the Windows default), session-registry warning paths past the 260-character boundary made `os.replace` fail and silently degraded PostToolUse into a health fail-open, losing scope warnings. `atomic_write` now normalizes to absolute paths and applies the `\\?\` extended-path prefix when either side crosses the boundary, preserving the open→flush→fsync→replace contract. Verified on the reproducing host with default temp paths (704 tests green without workarounds); 259/260/262-boundary and deep-warning regressions added.
- Probe runner now forces UTF-8 on the child pytest process so Korean failure tails are no longer mojibake; PASS/FAIL stays returncode-based.

### Added

- Scorecard coordination journal: a separate append-only `.fable-lite/scorecard/coordination.jsonl` (existing `gates.jsonl`, its closed `ReasonCode` enum, and default CLI output are unchanged). This wave records two categories — `r2_deny` (all eight destructive-guard block sites mapped onto four closed reason codes, plus the pre-resolution parse branch) and `turn_bootstrap` (`entered`/`recovered` pairs closed per actor and turn). Recording is laundering-resistant by construction: the R2 verdict itself stays fail-closed on the raw identity, while the journal entry is written only after `resolve_active_invocation()` settles the real identity, as fire-and-forget I/O that can never affect the gate decision (a read-only journal directory does not bypass R2). Remaining categories are reserved in the enum but not yet recorded.
- Scorecard CLI views: `python -m fable_lite scorecard --view sessions|agents|coordination` — `sessions` is the unchanged default; `agents` compares actors side by side; `coordination` renders the new journal. Root-level cross views stay a CLI read-time join; the core `SessionIdentity` model is unchanged and nothing new is auto-pushed into Stop output (quiet policy preserved).
- READMEs: project-scope plugin install path for true zero cost outside supervised projects (`claude plugin install ... --scope project`, per-project disable via `.claude/settings.local.json`), and the Antigravity host-status wording updated to the current facts (official-schema hooks.json parses and loads on host 1.1.2+; host execution of config-path hooks still unconfirmed).

### Known Limitations

- Turn bootstrap baseline persistence, ledger transition, and coordination observation use separate transactions to avoid lock re-entry; coordination IDs enforce one recovered observation per actor and turn, but the three operations are not a single atomic transaction.
- Coordination `--days`/`--session` filters apply to `entered` and `recovered` events independently; the CLI prints a hint when a counterpart may fall outside the selected window.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- **Claude Code adapter is now opt-in per project** ("Quiet Opt-in", spec: `docs/specs/v2.2-quiet-optin.md`). Hooks engage only when `<root>/.fable-lite/config.json` declares `{"schema_version": 1, "supervision": true}` (strict boolean). Inactive projects take a stdlib-only fast path: zero core imports, zero file writes, output exactly `{}`. Exact-home sessions are hard-off even with a config; projects under the home directory keep full supervision.
- Project root resolution no longer trusts the drifting tool `cwd`: `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` → write-once session registry latch (atomic, TTL-GC'd, cleaned by SessionEnd) → upward config search fallback. This eliminates the cd-drift false blocks (R1/Stop) observed in live sessions.
- Message diet: informational systemMessages (`observed N change(s)`, `provenance incomplete`, `recorded verification`, `Stop gate allow`, home advisory) are silenced while ledger recording is preserved. Block reasons stay visible; scope warnings dedupe to once per turn; health warnings (fail-open, corrupt registry/config, root mismatch) dedupe to once per session and are never silenced. Scorecard line is display-opt-in.
- Quick mode keeps full PostToolUse/PostToolUseFailure observation and atomically promotes the turn to normal before the first mutation-capable tool runs (promotion is exception-safe; if it cannot be persisted the tool is denied rather than fail-opened). Only provably read-only turns skip the heavy Stop reconcile, and they never claim "clean verified".
- PreToolUse denials emit `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: "deny"` instead of the deprecated top-level `decision: "block"`.
- Test harness: suite is hermetic against shared plugin-data state (`SMTW_TEST_FORCE_ENABLE=1` isolates per test); verified green on two heterogeneous runner environments plus a hostile shared-state environment.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Home-directory sessions (project root exactly equal to `$HOME`/`%USERPROFILE%`) now explicitly skip provenance instead of looping on `scope_too_large`. A home directory's scan volume structurally exceeds any budget (observed 11x: `.claude` alone is 2.8 GB, 61% of it the agent's own session logs), so provenance was blocking every turn and passing only via the fail-open cap without ever verifying anything (observed 9 cap-allows, 0 resolutions). Home root is now reported as `unsupported`/`home_root` with an actionable message (open the session from the project folder), snapshot scans are skipped entirely, and only the `scope_too_large`/`incomplete` provenance blocks are bypassed — investigation, design, and verification gates stay active. Exact home match only (case-folded, path-normalized); projects under the home directory keep full supervision.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added an opt-in design gate (default OFF). Enable it with `FABLE_LITE_DESIGN_GATE=1` or a project `design/gate.config` `{"enabled": true}` (project config wins over the environment variable). When enabled, UI-domain or UI-file-creation turns run `design_lint` on changed lines — raw hex/rgb/hsl colors, raw px spacing, and Tailwind arbitrary design literals — with DESIGN-OPS exception boundaries (token source files, `0`/`1px` hairlines, percentages, `currentColor`, SVG internals, and a path+rule+reason+expiry allowlist). Stop blocks a UI-touching turn until the lint passes and a render-verification tool call was observed, with an independent two-block fail-open counter. `fable_lite check --design` runs the lint on demand regardless of the toggle. Editing `design/gate.config` invalidates a prior pass, so an agent cannot launder an allowlist entry to bypass the gate. Adds the `design-review` pack and extends `verification-grounding` with design observation checks.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Fixed provenance false positives that structurally blocked Stop on home-directory, large-repo, and remote-mutation sessions. Shell effects are now classified as proven-read-only, proven-remote-only, or local-or-unknown (default), and a `git status` observation no longer marks a turn mutation-capable on its own.
- Hardened the config self-exemption path: `.fable-lite/provenance-config.json` is always tracked by the snapshot scanner, and git-tracked source paths are force-observed regardless of config `exclude`, so an agent cannot launder a backdoor by excluding a path and committing it.
- Fixed shell tokenization so a mid-word `#` no longer swallows subsequent operators; a change command after `#` is classified local-or-unknown, not read-only.
- Recognized loopback aliases (`127.1`, `0.0.0.0`, integer and short-form IPs, trailing-dot hostnames) so local ssh/scp edits are not misclassified as remote-only.
- Restored fail-closed handling when a post-mutation turn baseline is missing, preventing a concurrent observer from absorbing an unverified change.
- Attributed a deleted path to the current turn only when it existed in the turn baseline, so a pre-turn deletion no longer over-blocks a read-only turn.
- Replaced tracked-path discovery with `git ls-tree HEAD` plus staged additions and applied Windows case-folding, removing an intent-to-add false positive and a casing-based evasion.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added Session Quality Scorecard: an append-only gate journal, bounded per-session ledger cache, privacy-preserving CLI summaries, and optional Stop allow summaries for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Antigravity payloads.
- Added bounded provenance scans for 10,000 tracked entries, 256 MiB, and cooperative full/incremental deadlines. Oversized scopes now return an explicit advisory-only `scope too large` state without committing partial snapshots.
- Added conservative remote mutation epochs for direct `ssh` and local-to-remote `scp`. A separately started successful verification, including a local-only check, must cover the remote epoch; satisfying it does not prove that remote state was observed as clean. Local redirects, pipelines, downloads, command chains, substitutions, and unsafe SSH options do not use this relaxation.
- Expanded CI with Ruff, version synchronization, fresh W9 receipts, wheel build/install smoke, and a Windows nightly/tag workflow for randomized W9, W10, the eight-process Stop race, tag/version matching, and receipt artifacts.

### Fixed

- Removed the `quick`-mode exemption for non-document changes. Fresh successful verification is now required for code and other non-document artifacts in every task mode.
- Replaced substring-only verification recognition with shell-aware tokenization so output-only commands such as `echo pytest`, `printf`, `Write-Output`, comments, and print-only inline Python cannot unlock Stop.
- Tightened high-risk R1 contracts so `evidence` is required, must be a list of non-empty strings, and cannot be replaced with missing, scalar, empty, or whitespace-only values.
- Applied soft provenance exclusions at every path depth so nested dependency and cache directories do not trigger home-root scan blowups.
- Preserved frozen verification epochs and conservative local-mutation handling in oversized scopes, including SSH options that can create local files.
- Cleared the current Ruff findings without adding runtime dependencies.

### Changed

- Updated both READMEs to describe v2 state paths, Scorecard, the current deterministic probe result, the actual host-support matrix, and the limits below.

### Known Limitations

- Stop still fail-opens after two blocks. The harness supervises normal work discipline; it is not a complete defense against a deliberately evasive model.
- Files outside the project root and database or network side effects are not directly observed. Remote epochs prove only that a later verification command ran after the remote mutation, not that remote state was independently observed as clean.
- Full reconciliation near the 10,000-entry/256 MiB envelope can take several seconds. Deadlines are cooperative and cannot preempt one blocked OS call.
- Promise-only completion (`PRB-01`) and independent per-gate toggles (`PRB-11`) remain manual/unimplemented.
- Antigravity conformance is validated by payload injection; live firing on host 1.1.1 remains unconfirmed.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added - Change provenance

- Renamed the public product and plugin from `fable-lite` to `show-me-the-work` (`smtw`): the project grew from transferring Fable 5 working discipline into evidence-based AI work supervision. Internal `.fable-lite/`, `FABLE_LITE_*`, Python module, CLI launcher, and package identifiers remain compatible in v2.0.

- Added stdlib-only filesystem provenance with BLAKE2b-256 manifests, metadata fast-paths, full Stop reconciliation, Windows casefold collision handling, non-follow symlink/reparse safety, generation rebase, canonical multi-adapter replay, and per-turn verification covers.
- Added the 200-case W9 golden corpus and Git/non-git plus Claude Code/Codex/Antigravity replay receipts.
- Added the W10 1k/10k benchmark (`5` warm-ups + `30` measurements) with optional 50k/2GiB stress, percentile/read/stat/RSS metrics, atomic JSON receipt, and a two-receipt release migration guard.

### Release gate status

- Gates 1-10 and 12-13 in `docs/design/v2-provenance.md` section 17 are covered by the W1-W9 implementation and green W9 receipt: no tool-name-only events, parser-miss loss, no-op false positives, stale verification, Git/non-git drift, migration corruption, concurrency loss, adapter replay mismatch, Windows collision overwrite, or premature migration trigger; runtime remains stdlib-only.
- Gate 11 is green under the rev3 3-AI SLO reconsensus: representative 1k retains 200ms/1,000ms metadata/full p95 budgets, while extreme 10k uses measured 1,000ms/6,000ms budgets after a 1.48s isolated Windows lower-bound probe; native scanning remains rejected and the workload was not reduced.
- The final receipt records independent 1k and 10k hard gates, clean fast-path reads of 0 bytes, and aggregate green status. With the green W9 receipt, `record_event()` now permits the one-shot v1 ledger migration path.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added — Evidence integrity, host conformance, and release SSOT

- P0 Evidence Integrity adds conservative Antigravity verification-result parsing, monotonic ledger sequences with verification epochs, and a self-locating Codex installer whose four hooks work from projects outside the fable-lite checkout.
- Three-host Stop conformance now replays real Claude Code Stop, Codex CLI Stop, and Antigravity AfterAgent payload shapes for the shared two-block cap, fresh-verification recovery, and N1-marker recovery. Antigravity coverage is payload injection only, not proof that its host hook engine fires.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the version SSOT. The stdlib-only `scripts/sync_version.py` synchronizes marketplace metadata, `pyproject.toml`, and both README badges; `--check` reports drift without writing, and release hygiene compares every version surface.
- The classifier corpus distinguishes bare `next.js`/`node.js`/`vue.js` technology names from explicit file references and no longer treats `생성` alone as an observable artifact request. Real filenames and HTML/page/game/chart/SVG/UI targets retain their existing behavior.

### Fixed — P4 review hardening

- Applied nine review fixes: explicit Antigravity result signals now outrank ANSI-stripped text fallback; support checks reuse epoch-aware verification; docs changes do not advance the verification epoch; agent-log locks verify ownership; malformed tool names fall through to the next authoritative payload source; Codex installation refuses to overwrite an existing hooks file; failed Codex verification blocks Stop; fresh Antigravity verification allows Stop; and externally installed Codex hooks exercise the unverified-change block path.
- Antigravity payload handling now covers the observed `tool_response` result shape and string boolean signals while preserving conservative fallback when explicit result fields are absent.

### Known Limitations

- Antigravity 1.1.1 did not invoke the configured hook process in six live installation attempts. Its adapter remains tested through deterministic payload injection until the host exposes a working live hook engine; see `docs/reviews/p9-agy-live-hooks.md`.
- Moving the Stop block-counter update into the shared ledger transaction remains deferred to v2.0. Current per-file lock ownership is hardened, but multi-process Stop-counter serialization is outside v1.2 scope.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-08

### Changed — N1 markers only on turns that change files (user feedback)

- The N1 investigation-marker gate now applies only to turns that actually modified files. Answer-only turns ("why doesn't this work?") reply in plain prose — no `가설/증거/기각` block demanded. Rationale: the pack's purpose is "investigate before you modify"; forcing markers on a turn that modifies nothing is friction, not discipline.
- Ledger change/verification records are now reset per prompt (turn-scoped). Without this, one early edit kept `changed=True` for every later question turn in the session — an adversarial review (Critical-1) caught that the relaxation would have been ineffective before it shipped.
- Packs (ko/en) document the exemption, and still recommend recording markers for investigation-only turns so a later fix turn doesn't retro-invent its investigation.
- Known accepted limitation (documented, backlog): file edits made via raw shell commands are not counted as changes, so such turns bypass N1 — fable-lite's threat model is carelessness, not an adversarial model deliberately dodging its own gates.
- pytest 101 (4 new: exemption x2, per-turn reset, changed-turn still blocks), probes 15/15.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed — report style guidance (user feedback)

- Investigation packs (ko/en) gained a "Report style: body for humans, markers for the gate" section: the final report must lead with a plain-language body (no code identifiers/paths/line numbers; readers may be non-developers), with the marker block compressed to one line each at the bottom. Rationale: the N1 gate only parses marker existence, but models were letting the marker format drag the whole report into a technical document — forcing non-developer users to ask follow-up questions.
- N1 block message now carries the same hint ("markers are one compact line each at the bottom; keep the body in plain language"), so a blocked model rewrites toward a readable report instead of a more technical one.
- Gate logic unchanged: pytest 97, probes 15/15.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed — briefing false positives (real-world defect)

- Worker boot/role-injection prompts ("[부팅] ... read MEMORY.md and X.md ... then stand by") were classified as multi-story work: the two memory file paths alone tripped `needs_goals`, so the PreToolUse gate blocked the worker's first Bash/Edit calls twice and wasted 1-2 minutes per boot (observed live on a Sonnet worker pane).
- New briefing detection: a boot marker ("[부팅]", "세션 부팅", ...) or a stand-by closing ("대기하라", "standby", ...) suppresses `needs_goals`/multi-story/artifact signals — but only when no imperative action follows. Imperative-suffix matching keeps rule phrases ("...만 수정", "sentinel 파일 생성.") from counting as actions, while "[부팅] ... auth.py 고쳐줘" still gates (adversarial-review bypass guard).
- `is_debug` and `risk_flags` are intentionally NOT suppressed inside briefings: a boot prompt carrying a dangerous command still hits the R1 contract gate.
- Path mention counting no longer counts version strings (`v1.1.0`) or bare domains (`google.com`) as file paths.
- Word-boundary matching for multi-story terms: `and` no longer matches inside `commands`/`sandbox`; `여러분`, `12개월`, `multiply` no longer false-positive.

### Evidence

- Reproduced both reported boot prompts before the fix (`needs_goals=True`, spurious verification pack), confirmed suppression after (`needs_goals=False`, no packs), and confirmed the enumeration regression probe (PRB03) still blocks real multi-story prompts.
- pytest 92 (10 new classification tests), deterministic probes 15/15, live-payload hook E2E: boot prompt → Bash allowed; multi-story prompt → Edit blocked.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added — Intent Gate ("알" gate)

- Ambiguity scoring (`core/ambiguity.py`): signal-count score (0-4) with a conservative threshold of 2 and hard never-flag guards (questions, explicit paths, existing goals/intent, "그냥 해"). Scoring→threshold-gating methodology adapted from [Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code) (MIT).
- Intent-interview packs (`packs/intent-interview.ko.md` / `.en.md`): at most 3 questions, one at a time, multiple-choice first; explicit-assumption path (`--assumed`) when the user says "just do it".
- `fable_lite intent set/show/clear` CLI writing `.fable-lite/intent.json`; a new prompt auto-clears the previous intent.
- PreToolUse edit-lock: when a prompt is flagged ambiguous, Edit/Write/patch tools are blocked until `intent.json` exists (2-block cap, fail-open; Bash/read tools stay allowed so investigation can proceed).
- Self-locating launcher `fable-lite-cli.py` + absolute-path command injection: hooks compute their own install location and embed a copy-paste-runnable command into block reasons and injected context, so recovery works in plugin installs without `pip` and without relying on model path-hunting.

### Evidence

- Ambiguity corpus (41 real-style Korean prompts, adversarially authored by a different model): accuracy 100% — 0 false positives, 0 false negatives after a targeted fix round (initial run: FP 0, FN 7).
- Live nested-session E2E: ambiguous prompt → questions first and Edit genuinely blocked; clear prompt → zero added friction; "그냥 알아서" → assumption declared and recorded with `--assumed`; after the launcher fix, the model copy-executed the injected command verbatim and produced a standard-schema `intent.json` with no workarounds.

### Fixed

- BLOCKER (found in live E2E): `python -m fable_lite` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError` from arbitrary project directories under plugin installs — resolved via the self-locating launcher plus injected absolute-path commands.
- Verification OK-signal matching now uses word-boundary regex (`\bok\b`, case-insensitive): recognizes leading `ok ...` and `OK: ...`, with a regression test proving `broken` does not false-positive.

### Known Limitations

- Value-dump verification output with no pass/ok token (e.g. `add(2,3) = 5`) is conservatively treated as unverified — the safe direction (gate gets stricter, never looser).
- `확인질문 N:` marker adherence varies turn-to-turn; the gate is deterministic on `intent.json` file existence, markers are guidance.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

### Stabilized

- Core discipline engine: Korean-first prompt classification, investigation compliance markers, evidence-gated Stop checks, scope warnings, high-risk contract gating, ledger persistence, and goals checkpoints.
- Three adapter surfaces: Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Antigravity thin wrappers around the shared core behavior.
- Orchestrator CLI: `python -m fable_lite check` and `python -m fable_lite brief`, including task-card based delegation checks.
- Evaluation surface: deterministic probe runner, smoke harness, A/B methodology documents, and summarized review reports.

### Evidence

- Controlled A/B evaluation: fable-lite ON won 5/5 tasks against OFF in the blind-judged report.
- Live 3-CLI observation: Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Antigravity adapter paths were exercised as practical hook surfaces.
- Natural-compliance experiment: pack-only behavior failed to reliably enforce investigation markers, while the Stop gate recovered runs with concrete evidence.

### Known Limitations

- Verification recognition is centered on Python, JavaScript, shell, and common build/test runner patterns. Other ecosystems may need additional adapter policy.
- Evaluation sample sizes are intentionally small; the reports support release readiness, not statistical generalization.
- Sonamu Bot deployment assumes a host with Python available on `PATH` because hooks are stdlib Python scripts.
- fable-lite reproduces procedural discipline only. It does not claim to reproduce Fable 5 model-weight capabilities.
